Mojang AB provide a freely downloadable version of Minecraft for the
Raspbery Pi.  It comes with a Python API, which works only with
Python 2.

The main purpose of this project is to provide amend the API software
so that it also works with Python 3.  This helps new Raspi users (and
their teachers), because it means they can get going with knowing
anything about Python 2.
